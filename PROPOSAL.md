# IDEAS:
1. Terraria lobotomy edition
 
 Average bullet hell game but with terraria combat mechanics. Think of undertale but if you had wings and could dash and it wasn’t turn based.  
 
 Scope: all of it. If Mr K allows, this will be written with LWJGL because I have too much time on my hands

2. Clash royale

  It’s clash royale. Place troops down using elixir(max 10) to destroy towers. There are three towers: two princess and one king. King has more health than princess and doesn't attack unless provoked. Win if you destroy more towers than your opponent, or if you destroy the king tower, which is an automatic win.

3. Protect the Treasure(Our sanity) from Evil Monsters(College Board)

Those videos where they have to protect the money to keep it. Sorta like age of war but 2 dimensions instead of 1 and you also dont have a win condition. You have an objective to protect and money to spend to buy resources and protect it. After all your money is spent, the defense will face some sort of attack(like a bomb/atrocious AP exam) intended to destroy your defenses. Attacks get progressively harder, but in between rounds you get more money to spend and upgrade defenses.

  If Mr K allows, this will be written with LWJGL because I have too much time on my hands. Also this could probably have multiplayer snuck in.
