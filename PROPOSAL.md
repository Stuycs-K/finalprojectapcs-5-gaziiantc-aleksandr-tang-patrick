# IDEAS:
1. Terraria lobotomy edition
 
 Average bullet hell game but with terraria combat mechanics. Think of undertale but if you had wings and could dash and it wasn’t turn based.  
 
 Scope: all of it. If Mr K allows, this will be written with LWJGL because I have too much time on my hands

2. Clash royale

  It’s clash royale. Autobattler where you destroy enemy towers

3.Those videos where they have to protect the money to keep it. Sorta like age of war but 2 dimensions instead of 1 and you also dont have a win condition

  If Mr K allows, this will be written with LWJGL because I have too much time on my hands. Also this could probably have multiplayer snuck in.
