Our game is a physics-based tower defense game where you protect your moving base from waves of attacks. Unlike traditional tower defense games like BTD 6, your base follows a random path while you place defenses to protect it.

Features:

- 7 unique defense types with different properties
- Real-time physics simulation
- Progressive upgrade system (3 tiers per defense)
- Multiple attack types from enemies
- Economy management with cash flow
- Score system with level progression
- Cheat system for testing/experimentation

Defenses:
| Name | Feature |
|-----|--------|
| Wooden Wall | Most basic wall (flammable and easily destroyed) |
| Stone Wall | Slightly stronger than wooden wall (not flammable) |
| Metal Sheet | Strongest building |
| Void | Destroys a single projectile |
| Shield | Blocks projectiles for 10 seconds |
| Black Hole | Destroys projectiles for 5 seconds |
| Adsense  | Increases cashflow| 

Attacks:
| Name | Feature |
|-----|--------|
| Laser | Basic attack (bounces off walls) |
| Bomb | Slow-moving projectile that will explode in a radius upon impact |
| Missile | Pathfinds for an open path to the main base in a circular motion, stops searching after one full revolution |
| Train | Large block that moves extremely fast and with a ton of force, deals extreme levels of damage |
